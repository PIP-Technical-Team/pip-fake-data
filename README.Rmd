# pip-fake-data

The goal of pip-fake-data is to enable end-users to more easily explore the 
computations that generates the poverty and inequality statistics published on
[PIP](https://pip.worldbank.org/home)

Since most data used in PIP are confidential microdata, this fake dataset has
been created to match the exact format expected by the [pipapi](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/pipapi) package.

# Getting started

Make sure the `pipapi` package is installed on your machine.

```{r }
library(pipapi)
lkups <- create_versioned_lkups(data_dir = ".")
lkups$versions
lkup <- lkups$versions_paths$`20211212_2011_01_01_PROD`
```

## Run main `pip` function
```{r}
pip(country = "all", year = "all", povline = 1.9, lkup = lkup)
```


# Launch the API
```{r evaluate = FALSE}
# pipapi::start_api(
#   api_version = 'v1',
#   port = 80, 
#   host = '0.0.0.0')
```

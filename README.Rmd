# pip-fake-data

The goal of pip-fake-data is to enable end-users to more easily explore the 
computations that generates the poverty and inequality statistics published on
[PIP](https://pip.worldbank.org/home)

Since most data used in PIP are confidential microdata, this fake dataset has
been created to match the exact format expected by the [pipapi](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/pipapi) package.

# Getting started

1. Download the `pip-fake-data` repo on your machine
2. Open the `pip-fake-data` Rstudio project. This is will ensure your the
`pip-fake-data` folder is your working directory, which is a requisite for the
code below to work correctly.
3. Make sure the `pipapi` package is installed on your machine.   
__Temporary__ Please install the development branch of `pipapi` using the following
command: `remotes::install_github('PIP-Technical-Team/pipapi@dev')`

```{r }
library(pipapi)
lkups <- create_versioned_lkups(data_dir = ".")
lkups$versions
lkup <- lkups$versions_paths$`20211212_2011_01_01_PROD`
```

## Run main `pip` function
```{r}
out <- pip(country = "all", year = "all", povline = 1.9, lkup = lkup)
str(out)
```

## Look under the hood
If you'd like to see how the various PIP statistics are being computed, you can
easily run the `pip()` function in debug mode, and look at the computations line 
line.
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
debug(pip)
pip(country = "all", year = "all", povline = 1.9, lkup = lkup)
```

# Launch the API
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
pipapi::start_api(
  api_version = 'v1',
  port = 80,
  host = '0.0.0.0')
```
